JavaScript and DOM Manipulation HW

For this assignment, we had to create a table which dynamically filters through a UFO sightings dataset based on the date (date/time) of the sighting input by users (for the UFO-level-1 section of the assignment). For the second part of the assigment, we added multiple inputs tags so that users can filter the original dataset of UFO sightings by multiple filters including date/time, city, state, country, and shape.
